<p>For a hybrid city slicker like myself, East Tyrol is one of the nicest places I can recommend for a visit. It’s hard to believe but in some villages higher up the mountains they still have old huts without electricity and warm water. Guess what, during the summer months they are booked out by tourists who dig the smell of cow dung and wanna get away from everything. Digital detoxing or whatever.</p>

<p><br />
 I’m not the most romantic fella but spending the X-Mas holidays up there was always special to me. Surrounded by such a majestic mountain scenery, I suppose even hard pipe hittin’ crackheads might get a little misty. In the past, when I talked to my foreign friends about the picturesque qualities of that region, I frequently described it as some real-life Disneyland stuff. Especially with all the snow in winter, some villages are straight out of a picture book from the 50s. Sure, a bit of exaggeration among buddies can’t be negated but Hollywood could nevertheless shoot a real-life production of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” on any given day there. A Pepsi challenge really.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Over time I started to wonder how it’s like to grow up there. When you think about young folks high up in the mountains of Austria’s East Tyrol, what’s the first thing that pops into your head? Blank…? Well, I’m not blaming you. If I wouldn’t have been snowboarding there for the past 10 years, I’d have trouble spitballing myself. Actually, until I did a little photo project about quickly vanishing traditions in the region, I had very little understanding of what’s what when snow is out of the picture. I was curious to learn more about how generation Snapchat spends their time there. I didn’t exactly expect to find edgy characters like South L.A. Gs selling crack to five year olds or anything, but I was pretty sure not everybody is part of a church choir either. What surprised me though is that being chased by the police, driving underage without license plates and trespassing alpine shielings with motorbikes is not a big deal for some of the kids I met. But first things first.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>For folks who rarely venture into so-called “hinterlands”, I guess we should start with the usual stereotypes one might associate with rural areas like these. Scenic mountains with lots of free roaming cows—check—young guys who join the local fire fighters—check—dance groups that keep the Plattler traditions alive—check—teenage markswomen shooting rifles in the cellar of town hall—check—underage guys who tune their VW rides at home—CHECK! Also, kids who help with farming work, girls who learn to play traditional instruments like the Zither and younglings who go to church as altar servers are no rare sights to see. Stereotypes, sure, but all true. My impression was that keeping these traditions alive and well is important for the collective identity.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The trip got interesting when I ran into this young crew of gearheads who all grew up in the same village. What struck me immediately, there was nothing pretentious about these guys. They had strong, hearty laughs, were open, friendly, and not shy to talk about their lives. Taking their pictures was easy—even before I told them that we can possibly do an article for VICE. They kept it real and didn’t try to pose too much. I decided to leave out their names and exact hometown since I don’t want to cause them legal troubles for some of the stories they told me.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>On the surface, they looked like a bunch of kids around the age where you’d join the military and get a driver’s license. Funny enough, most of them learned to ride motor cycles at the age of six and already steered a car by the age of twelve—with their parents’ consent. Some started to drive even earlier, no biggie! I guess some things are a little different on the countryside after all. For guys their age, they carried themselves like men already—men who are used to handle responsibilities.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>They were very generous with their trust and soon invited me into the unofficial heart of the village, a little tree house. It was easy to see that this place has seen its fair share of history. It’s where they listen to YouTube music videos, quickly kill lots of beers—opened with the blade of an axe—and bust each other’s balls of course. In there, they chain-smoked more heavily than out of their mind bored New Jersey mob guys from the 70s. Besides sitting in this thick lung cancer fog, I had a good time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I learned that besides working at their families’ farms, they work as car mechanics, carpenters, locksmiths or joined the military which also supports their Olympic ambitions as air rifle marksmen. Careerwise, they seemed uninterested to go someplace else in the future. Few people move away I was told. After all, they described their village and the region in general as paradise. So, why leave? These mountains are not exactly a tropical island, but they have a point. When I recommended to maybe spend a vacation in Bali one day, for a moment the little tree house went a little more silent than expected. Frankly, I wasn’t quite sure if I insulted anybody.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After my fourth bottle of beer, taken from the crate I was sitting on, I realized these guys had preserved something childhood buddies easily loose when they leave for university or whatever. These close teenage bonds which are often forged over such “campfires”. The sort of friendships that feel like they could last a lifetime and would survive the proverbial horse theft but can also be gone in the blink of an eye if its ember is not looked after or treasured properly. Living in a small village like this, it’s not unlikely that they will keep their ties close and grow old together. Kinda nice when you think about it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When they started telling me stories about trespassing mountains on motor bikes, freely roaming around among cows and ski lifts, we seemed to get to the heart of it. Riding their bikes in the mountains seemed more than a little hobby. They were pretty serious about their sport and have been doing it for years. If you got the proper paperwork and all, you can ride on some forest roads but riding up in the mountains is illegal no matter what. We are not exactly talking about a mere cavaliers offense. If caught by the police, the fines wouldn’t be a joke. It can be as high as ten thousand Euros—for starters. Without license plates and / or a driver’s license, the bill would get quite a bit more spicy. A risk some of them are willing to take in order to pursue their passions.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>A little later that evening, I got introduced to a couple of other young guys who agreed to be photographed in action. They said they spend pretty much every free minute riding their Trial bikes up in the mountains. Jackpot! We agreed to meet a few days later and hide their identities for our photo shoot. What caught my attention right away was that none of their Trial and Motocross bikes had license plates or even have proper lights and blinkers. Unsurprisingly, they also bought their bikes well before they’d be old enough to legally ride them. Putting on plates would only mean trouble anyway. A photo taken by some random hiker tourist or the police could easily get them in trouble.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Even on the street that lead to the forest road that goes up the mountain, the lack of license plates or maybe even driver’s licenses seemed to bother nobody. If the police would wanna check up on them, they would simply disappear in the thick of the woods—just like that. Since police officials are said to have a bit of a laissez-faire attitude towards trial bikers and also lack the proper equipment to follow them, everybody was pretty chill about being stopped by cops. In fact, over a few more beers, I heard enough stories about such pointless police chases. The occasional encounter with eager yet chanceless officers of the law wouldn’t stop anybody from having a good laugh about it all.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>For our little photo session, we drove up a mountain where I usually like to ride my board in fresh powder. Without the snow, everything looked a little tilted in my mind. Same but different, you know? These ski slopes are like the guys’ backyard, an enviable paradise for anybody who can ride a bike. Endless mountains, killer views and not a soul that would disturb the action during the warmer seasons. Although local farmers are not happy with kids riding all over their properties—especially when the grass for the hay isn’t mowed and brought in yet—going to the police in such matters would come close to treason within the community.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The police is met with a suspicious eye and small matters are rather handled internally. When I asked why, I only learned that it was for historic reasons but I still have to pinpoint a more concrete explanation. I was told that pretty much 90% of the inhabitants tolerate what the kids are doing. They might even respect it as some coming of age thing among men. Only a few whacky individuals would rat them out. Everybody knows them and the boys know how to avoid their anger.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Driving cross-country with their motor bikes, up and down the mountains, seemed like the most natural thing to these kids. Also, if something would break, they would have the know-how to fix their bikes at home—in fully equipped workshops of course. Most of them wore no helmets or protective gear and only put on ski masks to protect their identity from the camera. They were skilled riders, no doubt about it. Not that they could compete on a pro level yet but they knew damn well what they were doing. You could tell that it was not their first rodeo and that they very much enjoyed their private little paradise.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To close this lengthy excursion into the wild, in my opinion, a lot of the villages have done an amazing job at keeping their traditions alive in these modern times of ours. As weird and unspecific as it sounds, I had the funny feeling that things are still much more in balance for people living there—especially for kids who grow up surrounded by all this nature.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Reflecting on this little trip though, it seems that even these tightly knit, healthy traditions are not inoculated from an exponentially developing computational future. Although cultural heritage still seems to play a significant role, the options to chase down your own destiny seemed to have broadened for young folks. In the past it was much more conventional to follow the path that is inherited by family and social standing. Nowadays, with a cheap supercomputer in everybody’s pocket, it is much easier to find new role models from all over the world.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It is worth noting that all of this is not a black and white zero-sum game. Younger generations who live in these mountains are perfectly fine to effortlessly switch between traditional contexts—like joining traditional dance groups—in the village and interests that represent modern, outside influences and passions. These things were much more mutually exclusive for prior generations. I was also happy to learn that girls started to enter a few domains that were previously occupied by men only. Maybe we will soon see young girls not only join the marksmen and become master bakers but also join the local fire fighters or ride their Trial bikes next to the guys. I wouldn’t be surprised.</p>
