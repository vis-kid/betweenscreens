  &lt;li&gt;What do you do for work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Were there any companies that were sort of a role model for what you do at Subvisual?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previously you were called Group Buddies right? Can you tell us more about that project and it’s name?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can you talk a little bit more about the technologies that you are using these days?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What about the new company name Subvisual?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So you said, as a company you were influenced a little bit by thoughtbot. Are you also into TDD &amp;amp; BDD as heavily as they are?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In hindsight, what was tricky about doing a startup?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you think it would it be much different to start this project today in Portugal?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you think it would have made a big difference building this startup near one of the startup hubs?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he story of King Lear and his three daughters is an old tale, well known in England for centuries before Shakespeare wrote the definitive play on the subject. The first English account of Lear can be found in the History of the Kings of Britain, written by Geoffrey Monmouth in 1135. However, it is clear that Shakespeare relied chiefly on King Leir, an anonymous play published twelve years before the first recorded performance of Shakespeare's King Lear. Read on to find out more about Leir and see side-by-side versions of Leir and Shakespeare's masterpiece. he story of King Lear and his three daughters is an old tale, well known in England for centuries before Shakespeare wrote the definitive play on the subject.
